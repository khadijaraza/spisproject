Sudisha and khadija's final project for ucsd spis 2025
Binary stars, exoplanets, etc. are often discovered through the transit method, which detects dips in brightness from orbiting a larger star. 
This project aims to train data from light curves' dips in brightness so that we can determine if they are coming from either an exoplanet or star. Utilizing ML is essential as the volume of light curve data from K2, Kepler, and TESS is increasing at an exponential rate.
